To solve the language compatibility problem we use the General Approach:

We define the array of languages known by Shaun, which contains 6 languages.
Then prompt the user to enter their name.
Ask the user to input the number of languages they know.
Create an empty vector to store the user's known languages.
Use a loop to read the languages known by the user and add them to the vector.
Create an unordered set from the Shaun's languages array for efficient lookup.
Iterate through the user's languages vector and check if each language exists in the Shaun's languages set.
If a language is found in both Shaun's and the user's languages, print the message: "Both Shaun and 'username' can communicate in 'language'".
Repeat the above step for each language in the user's languages vector.
End the program.
